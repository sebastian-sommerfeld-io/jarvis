= module.sh

Jarvis module to push files to a remote git repo.

== Overview

This script switches the display inputs for my Dell monitors to
avoid having to use the monitors physical buttons.

The script is designed to only work on the `caprica` host and fails if
another machine runs this script.

NOTE: Don't run this script directly! Always run the `jarvis` command and select the module of choice.
