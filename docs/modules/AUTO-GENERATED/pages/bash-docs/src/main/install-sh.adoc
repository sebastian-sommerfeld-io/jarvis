Install jarvis to `/opt/jarvis` and make executable via `/usr/bin/jarvis`.

== Overview

The script installs jarvis to `/opt/jarvis` and makes jarvis executable via
`/usr/bin/jarvis`. All jarvis assets are cloned from Github during the installation. To update the
installation, just run this script again.

CAUTION: Be aware that running this script might result in conflicts with other (unrelated) software
packages of the same name because /usr/bin/jarvis might belong to something else.

NOTE: `$LOG_INFO` and `$LOG_DONE` are declared inside this script to be available in all Linux
environments, not just when present in a users `.bashrc` file. Without these variable declarations
the script fails with error message `unbound variable` due to the `set -o nounset` directive.

=== Script Arguments

The script does not accept any parameters.
