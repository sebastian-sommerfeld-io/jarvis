Bash module which provides utility functions for logging.

== Overview

This script is bash module which provides a logging library for Bash scripts. This
module is part of the link:https://github.com/sebastian-sommerfeld-io/jarvis[Jarvis project]. It
allows you to log messages with different log levels (debug, info, warning and error).

This module is intended to show log information to user who interacts with the bash command line.
So all output is written to `stdout`. By default this module does not write to any files. To log
to files, redirect the output to a file of your choice (`LOG_INFO "Some log line" >> some.log`).

To use the logger library, include the following line in your Bash script:
[source, bash]

----
#!/bin/bash

# Some code if needed but make sure to include this module somewhere at the top of your script

# Download and include logging library
