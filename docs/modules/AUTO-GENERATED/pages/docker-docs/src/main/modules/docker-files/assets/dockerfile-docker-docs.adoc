== Overview

...
todo ... write description and brief (above)

== Prerequisites

This image has been developed and tested with Docker version 24.0.2 on top of Ubuntu 22.10.

== About the tags and versions

This Docker image follows a tagging convention based on semantic versioning. Each
stable version of the image is tagged with a specific semantic version (e.g.
`:v0.2.0`), while the `:latest` tag always points to the most recent stable
version.

Unstable versions are marked with a suffix (`-alpha.0`, `-beta.0` or `-rc.0`).
These versions usually are used for development or testing purposes. These versions
are not recommended for production use. `:latest` never points to an unstable
pre-release.

The image may have a `:ci` tag, which represents an unstable build. These versions
come from CI builds and/or nightly builds and are useful for continuous integration
and testing purposes. The `:ci` tag is never meant for production use and may
contain experimental features or unresolved issues.

== How to use this image

todo ... at least update the image names below
