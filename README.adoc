== About this project
This project assists with daily tasks and helps reducing time and overhead by automating some simple tasks like initializing a new link:https://antora.org[Antora] component or creating SSH keypairs.

Jarvis uses a modular achitecture to add new featues. This allows every module to choose the toolset on its own (Plain Bash scripts, Docker, Groovy, ...) as long as it is started by a Bash command.
