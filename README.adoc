== About this project
This project assists with daily tasks and helps reducing time and overhead by automating some simple tasks like initializing a new link:https://antora.org[Antora] component.

Jarvis uses a modular achitecture to add new featues. This allows every module to choose the toolset on its own (Plain Bash scripts, Docker, Groovy, ...) as long as it is started by a Bash command.

== How to use this project
To install this project simply use the bootstrap script `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sebastian-sommerfeld-io/jarvis/main/src/main/install.sh | bash -`.

To use this project, just run the `jarvis` command from your bash.

NOTE: Keep in mind that this project was developed for Ubuntu.
